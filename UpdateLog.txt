Updated the project name
Implemented Music Enable/Disable in Main Menu and Offline Mode
Most of the strings in Offline Mode are translated based on locale (All changes for the translation have "//Changed" tag, delete after review)
	Exceptions: "The game ends whenever a player reaches +/- of target score" - too hard to translate
		    Some other japanese strings (can be seen in string.xml or the editor of string.xml) - too hard to translate
	Issue: Changing the language during the game does not update the strings completely
